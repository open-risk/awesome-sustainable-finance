## Awesome Sustainable Finance

That you for your interest in the **Awesome Sustainable Finance**. This a curated list that aims to be a comprehensive catalog of open source Sustainable Finance resources. 

### Scope

The focus of the list is primarily on *Open Source Code* (tools, libraries, frameworks etc.). In scope are any projects that, more-or-less, directly support sustainable finance efforts, irrespective of product or market. 

Included in the scope are also any related *Open Data* sets that are useful in a sustainable finance context. Not included are general purpose finance oriented resources.
There is a broader range of *Sustainability* oriented resources that may only partially overlap with current Sustainable Finance use cases. Some relevant collections are listed at the end.

### Further Notes

- The inclusion and classification of projects in different categories is not meant to be rigorous. Projects provide sometimes both code and data and may have wider or overlapping sustainability objectives.
- The preference is to link directly to openly accessible and self-contained repositories with code or data (thus no social-media accounts or web blogs / pages). 
- In similar vein, the list does aspire to include Powerpoint presentations, PDF reports etc. 
- Projects in preliminary alpha phase are welcome (but they should not be simply placeholders). 
- If there are special circumstances we will try to accommodate.
