## How to Contribute

If you want to add your own project or suggest a project you are using simply create a PR with the required update (a link to the repository) with a brief caption

If you want to nominate a project but do not have a GitHub account you can also point to relevant resources and we will do the update:
- at the [Open Risk Commons](https://www.openriskcommons.org/t/awesome-sustainable-finace/159)
- at the [Sustainable Finance Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainableFinance/)
- at our [Mastodon Account](https://mastodon.social/@openrisk)
- at our [bluesky Account](https://bsky.app/profile/openrisk.bsky.social)

## Notes

- The inclusion and classification of projects in different categories is not meant to be rigorous. Projects provide sometimes both code and data and may have wider or overlapping sustainability objectives.
- The preference is to link directly to openly accessible and self-contained repositories (not accounts or web-pages) but if there are special circumstances will accommodate.
- The list does not include powerpoints or PDF's.
- Projects still in alpha phase are welcome but not if they are simply placeholders (with very little content).
