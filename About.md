# About the Awesome Sustainable Finance list

The main data file containing the list is a collection of project names, brief descriptions and links in markdown format. 

We are experimenting with alternative formats for expanded usability:
- [Tabular](TABULAR.md). This is the list in tabular format, with categories forming different tables.
- An [OPML](asf_feeds.opml) version that represents the list using the OPML(XML) format
